# bubbleSort
bubble sort algo. use for minimal array.



Advantages of Bubble Sort:

Simplicity: Bubble Sort is very simple to understand and implement.

Memory efficient: It does not require any additional storage space other than the array itself.

Stable: It is a stable sorting algorithm. It maintains the order of equal elements in the sorted array.

Disadvantages of Bubble Sort:

Time complexity: Bubble Sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), which means that it is not suitable for sorting large datasets.

Performance: Bubble Sort is not efficient for sorting large datasets or datasets with a complex structure. It requires a large number of comparisons and swaps, leading to slower performance compared to other sorting algorithms.

Inefficient: Bubble Sort is not efficient for sorting datasets that are nearly sorted or already sorted. It will still compare and swap elements unnecessarily, leading to a waste of time and resources.

Lack of adaptivity: Bubble Sort does not adapt to the structure of the dataset being sorted. It will always take the same number of steps to sort a dataset, regardless of its initial state or the presence of partially sorted subsets.
